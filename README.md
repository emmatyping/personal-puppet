# My Puppet config

After making https://github.com/ethanhs/windows-setup, I realized that puppet would serve my uses
so much better. So here we are!

My goal is to use Puppet to configure my 3 main devices:
 - My desktop running Windows 10 (mostly done?)
 - My laptop running Ubuntu Desktop (waiting for Focal to come out before puppeting)
 - My server running Ubuntu Server (also waiting for Focal)

Note that this config is inspired by https://github.com/asottile/personal-puppet, and I am greatly
indebted to Anthony for help in setting this config up, so thanks to him!

I also have taken bits and pieces from the [OCF puppet](https://github.com/ocf/puppet).
